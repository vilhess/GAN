# GAN AI Model with Streamlit 🤖🎨

This repository contains a simple application that demonstrates the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to the MNIST dataset. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. 🚀

## What is a GAN? ❓

A GAN is a type of generative model that consists of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial training. The generator creates synthetic data, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated data. This adversarial process results in the generator producing increasingly realistic data. 🧠

## What can a GAN be used for? 🤔

GANs find applications in image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation, and more. They excel in generating high-quality, realistic data samples, making them valuable in various creative and data-driven fields. 📈

## How does a GAN work? 🤖

A GAN operates by having the generator and discriminator compete against each other. The generator aims to create realistic data to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated data. This adversarial loop continues until the generator produces data that is indistinguishable from real data. 🧪

## MNIST Digit Generation 📊

In this section, we leverage the GAN model to generate realistic digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. First, we display some examples of real MNIST digits that were used during the training process. Then, we showcase images generated by the GAN model. Users can witness the diversity and realism achieved by the generator in creating new digits. 🖼️

## How to run the application 🚀

Follow these steps to run the GAN application on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set the device to your device in the .env file.
4. Run the application using `streamlit run DCGAN.py`.

*Note: This project is based on the DeepLearning.ai course.*
